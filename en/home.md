What is Elexis? {#what}
---------------
Elexis is an Eclipse RCP program for all aspects of a medical practice:
electronic medical record (EMR), laboratory findings etc., as well as
accounting, billing (swiss TARMED-System, other systems to be
developped) and other daily work.

A fully functional version (including only a small set of plug-ins in
order not to confuse newcomers) may be downloaded via the “Files” tab.
Users may optionally include a demo database to have a playground for
experiments.

The [Elexis Forum](http://elexis-forum.ch/) is the place where
(Swiss-German) users share their experiences.

The site http://www.elexis.ch contains a lot of (sometimes outdated)
information as it is not actively maintained.

Developers and anybody trying to compile Elexis from scratch should look
at our [OOMPH based
installer](https://github.com/elexis/elexis-3-core/tree/master/ch.elexis.sdk)
