----------

Elexis is (until now) only available for Swiss medical practitioners.

Adpating it to another legal system (eg. Germany, France) would require writing an additional billing plugin, which would probably need quite a lot of work
(eg. 1 man year for a skilled Eclipse RCP developer with access to the regulation)

Please feel free to contact the developers via their [mailing list](https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=elexis-develop).
